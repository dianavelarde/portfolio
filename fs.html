                <p class="gutter-half"> The Freshly Squeezed logo was created to emphasize on freshness
and originality of the company. The main objective of the company is to serve freshness within every cup, this logo was designed to convey the this objective. This logo relates more to the history of the company and gives a throw back of how it got started by simply selling orange juice. The challenge with this logo was getting the target audience to see that Freshly Squeezed has various products, this is where the colours of the logo came in. The squeezing motion also came into play in this logo which is why one pieces comes out as a drip </p>

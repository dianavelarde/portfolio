                <p class="gutter-double pad-bottom-double">My name is <strong>DIANA VELARDE </strong>. I love the creative process of art. Through my work i’d like to show how far design can go and on a deeper note, how it can change the world. In the last few years I’ve learned that the most simplest of sketches can evolve  into the most incredible pieces of work. I think I have fallen in love with the that process…..between sketch and outcome. </p>

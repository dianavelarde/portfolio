                <p class="gutter-half"> "Cirque du Soleil began with a very simple dream. A group of young entertainers got together to amuse audiences, see the world, and have fun doing it. Every year, the audiences get bigger, we continue to discover new places and ideas and we're still having fun." — Guy Laliberté </p>
                <p class="gutter-half"> The Annual Report for Cirque du Soeil has to represent the fun and playfull aspect a circus has, as well as the seriousness an annual report should have in order to be readable. The color of the photos has influenced the color choice throughout the design and layout.</p>

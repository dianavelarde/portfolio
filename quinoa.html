                <p class="gutter-half"> Clic is company that exports quality food products. They offer a range of over 1,400 products, including pulses,grains, rice, beverages, condiments, pasta, dairy products, dried fruit and nuts, confectionery items, oils, vinegars, blossoms, frozen vegetables, ready-to-eat meals, gourmet specialties and canned foods. Peru is one of the biggest providers of quinoa worldwide and it is where Clic has exported the quinoa. Quinoa grows in abundance in Peru, in particular in one of the provinces of Peru, Puno.
Puno belongs to the Andean region of Peru, where people still wear traditional colourful clothing and practice traditional rituals. In the streets of Peru, quinoa is sold by bulks and each vendor places their bags of products around to sell. These bags are made of thick material much like a burlap
fabric. Which is what lead me to this design, inspired by the origins of where Quinoa comes from and how it's sold. </p>

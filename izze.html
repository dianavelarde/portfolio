                <p class="gutter-half"> Izze is a brand known for its natural taste and ingredients. What makes the product unique is its sparkling, yet natural infused drink. A broader meaning of nature consists of plants, animals, landscapes and fruits. Mother Nature is a common personification associated with all things that describe nature. My concept has focused on the natural aspect the drink offers. “Mother Nature’s Favourite Drink” represents two things. One, is Mother Nature representing the naturalness of the drink and two, it suggest that this is the most natural drink there is by adding the words “Favourite Drink” to the headline. The secondary text goes more into detail of the brand, which also helps support the imagery. </p>

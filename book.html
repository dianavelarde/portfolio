                <p class="gutter-half"> Street Pharm is story a young man whobegins to deal drugs primarily because heis in need of money. It is a dramatic storyof what he goes through due to his drugdealing business.In original cover the imagery is not clear.At first glance a viewers would a hard time what is in the background, there is to much contrast making the road look shinny and unreal. Second, the bag in the middle is very random, compared to the ground sewer circle the bag is far to big, drugs dealt in the streets are usually dealt
in far smaller bags. The circle in the left corner gives it a sense that it is a street, but it serves no purpose in the content of the story it self. The tittle of the book is almost going of the cover, which makes everything else look more clutter, the graininess of the type makes the cover look badly printed. The authors name in red is also a random color; the red in the authors name competes with the title of the book. </p>
